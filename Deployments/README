The 'ip-webapp' subdirectory contains the implementation of the webapp, based on a Maven pom.
There are two versions of the webapp, which get packaged (by the two Dockerfiles) into two
different Docker images:
mriehm/ip-webapp:v1
mriehm/ip-webapp:v2
See ../Services for a Service (LoadBalancer) definition for this Deployment.
