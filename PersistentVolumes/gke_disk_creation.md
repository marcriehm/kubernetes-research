# GKE Disk Creation

To create a disk in GKE, navigate to Google Cloud Platform --> Compute Engine --> Disks and hit the Create Disk button. Set the Name to “pv-disk”. Set the Region to be your compute region (e.g. us-central1) and the zone to be your compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a). Leave the Size at 500GB (important for later). Leave all else the same and hit Create.
Now you need to format the disk to ext4. To do this, we’ll create a temporary Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM Instance. From GCP --> Google Compute Engine --> VM Instances, click Create Instance. Set the region and zone appropriately, as above. You can leave all else unchanged. Wait for the instance to be created. Click on the instance link. Click the Edit button at the top. Scroll down to Additional Disks and click Attach existing disk. Select your “pv-disk” and click the Done button. Scroll down and click Save to attach pv-disk to your instance. You should still be in the VM Instance Details. Near the top, click the Remote Access “SSH” button. Type lsblk and you should see an unmounted block device named sdb. Type sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -F -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard /dev/sdb. Wait. Type sudo mkdir -p /mnt/disks/pv-disk. Type sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/sdb /mnt/disks/pv-disk. Type sudo chmod a+w /mnt/disks/pv-disk. You’re done. Exit the ssh shell. You don’t need your temporary GCE instance any more so delete it.

You're done!
